# Redux Sagas Movie List

## Description

Duration: 3 days.

An application that stores movie descriptions, titles, poster urls, and genres to a database.

On the main page the entire list of movies stored in the database are appended onto the DOM. Each movie can be clicked on to be taken to a details page of that movie, showing the title, description, and genres of the movie. There's also an add movie page that allows the user to add more movies to the database.

All axios routes are handled with redux sagas, and on return from the server dispatch to the redux reducers. 

## Built With

React.js, React-Redux, Redux-Saga, Axios, Node.js, PostgreSQL
